# Beginnings of creating mods in minecraft
# I need help already. I have been following a youtube tutorial by 
# Modding by Kaupenjoe. It has been very informative, but I can't
# seem to get the textures right. I rewatched his tutorial 5 times
# and copied what he had. I did change my MOD_ID, but I don't
# think that was the issue.
